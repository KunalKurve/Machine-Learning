StratifiedKFold is meant to used with Classification Models only 
With Regression Use K Fold only.

# Gaussian Naive Bayes comes under Kernel NB which deals with Numerical data
# There is Discrete Naive Bayes for categorical Data


predict()
gives category of maximum probability
in array data type

argmax() : gives index of highest probability

ROC is only calculatable for bi-class Datasets 

LabelEncoder() - needed to encode categorical data

binning - converting discrete data to categorical like age to age-group, income to income-slab
pandas.cut() is a function to do it in dataframes.


Logistic Regression is used for Classification type problems not Regression
Types - 
Binary, Multinomial, 


Logistic Response Function has a Sigmoid function graph
Range of Linear Regression = [-inf, +inf]
Range of Logistic Regression = [0,1] = answer will always be a probability
Different from Naive Bayes's answer - it is not a sigmoid function graph.
