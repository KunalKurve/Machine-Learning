Anomaly Detection:
- Outlier Detection
- An actual data point significantly outside a distribution’s mean or median is an outlier.
- An anomaly is a false data point made by a different process than the rest of the data.
- An outlier is a valid data point, and can’t be ignored or removed, whereas noise is garbage that needs removal.
